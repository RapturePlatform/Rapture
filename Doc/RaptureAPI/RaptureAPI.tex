\part{Rapture}
\chapter{Background}
\Rapture is a platform system that can be used to build applications that are scalable,
distributed, consistent and coordinated. At its heart \Rapture is simply a well defined
set of libraries with an external facing api that provides an abstraction to a number
of fundamental concepts. This document describes the APIs of \Rapture in detail from the
perspective of a programmer - alongside each API call are sections on their use within
\Rapture and typical use cases for that API or API set.

The general architecture of a \Rapture system is reproduced in Figure~\vref{fig:RaptureDiagram}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Graphics/rapturecore}
\caption{Rapture Component Parts}
\label{fig:RaptureDiagram}
\end{figure}

Applications that interact with \Rapture, or are \emph{hosted} on \Rapture will
use the \Rapture API to interact with this underlying framework. The goal of
the \Rapture API is that the interaction with \Rapture is invariant to the location
of the application -- the API looks \emph{the same} no matter where the application
resides.

This document presents an overview of \Rapture and its scripting language \Reflex. The first
part contains more general background to \Rapture and presents an overview of its parts. The second
part is a detailed description of the API calls that can be made of a \Rapture system. Finally the third
part presents the \Reflex scripting language.

\chapter{Main Rapture concepts}

The API section of this document gives a more thorough treatment to each of the major concepts in \Rapture. This section
presents a general overview of the major themes. Nearly every concept in \Rapture and the entities that describe it are
referenced using a uri naming scheme. The following sections describe these concepts.

\section{Data}
One of the prime uses of \Rapture is to manage access to data. \Rapture has the concept of a \emph{repository} which is a
reference to either a data store managed by \Rapture (the data is only updated by \Rapture applications) or
the data is externally managed and \Rapture is simply accessing it "remotely".

Repositories in \Rapture are divided into types.

\subsection{Document Data}
Document data repositories manage data as key/value pairs. The key in \Rapture is a document uri and the value
is typically (but not necessarily) a JSON formatted document. As an example, an abstract view of a document repository would map the following:

\begin{Verbatim}
	doc://test/one/two/three

	{
	  "field" : "value",
		"one" : 1,
		"array" : [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
		"inner" : {
			"a" : 0,
			"b" : 1,
			"c" : true
		}
	}
\end{Verbatim}

The first part of a document uri (\Verb+test+ in the above example) is a reference to a
document repository which is defined by calling the \Rapture API call "createDocRepo". A
document repository in \Rapture is hosted on an underlying database such as MongoDB or Cassandra
and can be versioned. Each document can have metadata associated with it - some information maintained
directly by \Rapture (such as write time, write user) and some information managed directly by
an application.

You can also append on a version qualifier to the end of a document uri. This gives an application
developer the ability to reference absolutely a piece of content in \Rapture that is invariant.

Documents in \Rapture that are formatted as JSON documents work well with the \Reflex scripting language. When
you load a document from \Rapture into \Reflex it is automatically converted into a special "map of maps" structure
which is easily accessible in the scripting language. As an example consider the code below:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Reflex document example}, language=reflex]
  doc <-- "//test/one/two/three";
	assert(doc.one == 1);
	doc.one = 2;
	doc --> "//test/one/two/three";
\end{lstlisting}

This example takes the example document above, tests the value of the "one" field and then
changes it to the value of 2. It then writes that document back to \Rapture, which will create a new
version of that document.

\subsection{Series data}

Series data embraces the concept where instead of having a single document (or data value) at a given
uri you would prefer to reference a whole set of documents each indexed with a unique "column" key. If those
keys represent points in time (perhaps "20160101") then the series could represent time series data.

Series repositories are used to manage this particular type of data. Such data could be represented in a document
repository - the uri for the document could include the point in time or the column key. A series repository is simply
much more efficient at storing and accessing this type of data and special API calls are available to return sub-parts of
the series.

The content stored in an individual point of a series can contain any arbitary value type. Typically the value will be
numeric but strings or more complex structures (such as JSON formatted documents) are also supported.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Graphics/SeriesExplain}
\caption{Rapture Series Structure}
\label{fig:RaptureSeriesStructure}
\end{figure}

Figure~\vref{fig:RaptureSeriesStructure} shows the association between a series uri in \Rapture and the data
it "points" to.

\subsection{Blob Data}

Blob (Binary Large OBject) data is used in \Rapture to store data that has some structure or value to an
external application but has no real "meaning" internally to \Rapture. The uri reference to a blob in \Rapture
points to a sequence of bytes -- \Rapture understands (and maintains) the mime-type of the data and its length
and other attributes such as the last writer and write time but it is really just an arbitary store of information.

\Rapture applications tend to use Blob repositories to store spreadsheets, cvs files, images, application code and the like.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Graphics/RaptureBlobExplain}
\caption{Rapture Blob Structure}
\label{fig:RaptureBlobStructure}
\end{figure}

Figure~\vref{fig:RaptureBlobStructure} shows an example blob uri pointing to a csv file
used in an import/processing application.

\subsection{Structured Data}

Structured data is an alias for "relational data". Structured repositories (equivalent to databases and tables in
a relational database) are used in two completely different ways.

\subsubsection{Internal Structured Data}

A structured data repository can be used internally within an application to store information that is relational in
layout -- the internal reference implies that applications only modify and access this information through the \Rapture API. With
this restriction \Rapture can manage server side caching of the information and propogate changes in a distributed manner to
other servers in a \Rapture environment.

\subsubsection{External Structured Data}

An external structured data repository is simply a well described connection to an external database (and table set). The idea
is that applications and process that are using other \Rapture facilities (the other data types described here, workflows etc.) can
treat this type of external data in the same manner and have a single mechanism for accessing and joining these disparate data sets. In addition
the entitlements system of \Rapture can be used to control access to such a resource.

\section{Workflows}

With data under control with a consistent access mechanism and naming conventions there is often a need in an enterprise application to
manipulate and transform this data in consistent ways. Programs that manipulate data (or do other tasks) can often be broken down into a set of steps
and a workflow in \Rapture is a vehicle for managing the execution of those steps in a controlled and distributed manner.

A sample workflow in \Rapture is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:WorkflowExample}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Graphics/RaptureWorkflowExplain}
\caption{Rapture Workflow}
\label{fig:WorkflowExample}
\end{figure}

This workflow, with the unique reference "workflow://processor/file/one" begins at the start step. The first
task (or step) that is executed is "Check for Files". The implementation of a step in a \Rapture workflow can be either
a piece of Java code that is embedded in the \Rapture server (as shown as a workflow extension in Figure~\vref{fig:RaptureExtensionPoints})
or can be a \Reflex script hosted on \Rapture itself. After doing its work the step execution code returns a status code - a piece of text
that is used to point to the next step that will be executed. In this case returning "ok" will move it to the "import file" step and returning
"no files" can point it to the "wait for a while" step. These steps execute in a similar way and the workflow execution continues until we
reach the "End" point.

In a real workflow the "Wait for a while" step would ultimately error out after an extended time.

Workflow steps are associated with server groups and any server in a group can be used to process that step. In this example the yellow first step
needs to run on a special server that has access to a specific file location - once the file(s) are located they are imported into a \Rapture blob repository
and the other steps can run on any server in the environment. This technique and approach allows \Rapture workflows to be distributed across a compute fabric while
still maintaining some constraints on execution.

Workflows can be started (run) using the \Rapture API (see the Decision API later on in this document) or attached to events or schedules.

\section{Scripts}

Scripts in \Rapture refer to programs written in the \Reflex scripting language. That language is described later on in this document.

Scripts have unique references (uris) in \Rapture and can be used in many different ways. Some of the typical use cases are enumerated below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Workflow steps can use scripts as part of their execution.}
	\item{Scripts can be run one-off as mini-programs through the \Rapture API.}
	\item{Scripts can be run upon an event firing.}
	\item{Scripts can be executed as part of an AJAX call to a service -- usually returning JSON data controlled by parameters passed in the service call.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pipelines and Messages}
\Rapture can be a multi-server environment. Coordination is needed between individual servers and this is accomplished through messaging. These messages are
used to coordinate workflow activity or the initiation of any asynchronous style activity. \Rapture abstracts the concept of messaging and message queues from their
implementation. The \Rapture kernel requires at least one of these "pipelines" to be setup for a system to run. In a single server environment
this could be an in memory (in process) implementation - in a multi-server environment the open source RabbitMQ implementation is recommended.

Figure~\vref{fig:PipelineExample} shows the different types of pipeline that could exist in a \Rapture environment.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Graphics/PipelineExplain}
\caption{Rapture Pipeline}
\label{fig:PipelineExample}
\end{figure}

The same pipeline system can be used by applications as well. Applications create queues on exchanges and can be both a publisher and a consumer of custom messages
sent on those queues. Some queues could have no endpoint within \Rapture -- they could imply connectivity to external applications and systems. Conversely such queues could
represent inbound queues from external systems. This abstraction separates the application code (the publisher and consumer) from the actual implementation of the transport.


\section{Jobs and Schedules}

In a \Rapture environment running a batch process in a production context it is often required to scheduled repeating tasks in a consistent manner.

\Rapture has the concept of a schedule manager where you can define jobs that can execute according to the evaluation of a cron style specification. These jobs
can be used to run scripts or workflows and there are many operational style API calls that can be used to monitor their progress.


\chapter{Application Locations}
Applications interacting with \Rapture will typicall fall within one of the
following categories.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Client applications interacting with a remote \Rapture environment.}
  \item{Client \Reflex scripts using the ReflexRunner application. These behave like client applications as far as \Rapture is concerned.}
  \item{Server applications embedding the \Rapture kernel.}
  \item{Scripts running on a server that is itself running the \Rapture kernel.}
  \item{Extensions to \Reflex or repository or message drivers.}
  \item{Scripts run in the context of an ajax call from a web browser.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Graphics/RaptureExtensionPoints}
\caption{Rapture Extension Points}
\label{fig:RaptureExtensionPoints}
\end{figure}

The diagram of Figure~\vref{fig:RaptureExtensionPoints} shows the places in which these extensions can take
place. Typically a \Rapture environment or application suite is a combination of some of these -- and Incapture Technologies
can provide some enterprise extensions (particularly in the low level extensions space) that can assist in rounding out an
application.

\section{Context and Entitlements}
Every interaction with a \Rapture API call is made in the context of a logged in
user. That user, and its entitlement group membership and the parameters passed
to the call are used to determine whether the call can proceed or not. If an
API call is used to run a script on \Rapture or to start a workflow \emph{that} script
or workflow is run in the context of the calling user as well.

In some API use categories the interface used to interact with the \Rapture API
is already bound to a user - typically this is for processes that are running
server side. Client side use cases usually have to \emph{login} to \Rapture first,
providing credentials that get translated by the \Rapture API into a \verb+CallingContext+
value (a token) which can then be used in subsequent calls to identify the user
making the call. In some client side languages there are helper constructs that
can be used to automatically pass in the logged in context to the API calls,
leaving the programmer free to not worry about this aspect.

Wrapper applications such as ReflexRunner log in on the caller's behalf and then
pass that logged in API context to the underlying container that runs the script.

\section{Custom client applications}

Client applications that talk to \Rapture can be written in any of these supported languages as
long as the application can reach (using TCP/IP) a \Rapture API Server.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Java (or anything that runs on the Java VM and can access Java classes.)}
  \item{.NET}
  \item{Python}
  \item{Javascript (typically node.js, see a later section on architectures for browser applications.)}
  \item{Ruby}
  \item{Go(lang)}
\end{itemize}

The transport between client and server uses a JSON-RPC style of communication which
means that other language support can easily be added. The build process for
\Rapture can autogenerate client side stubs once an initial template has been
created - the authors created the .NET implementation in a few hours.

Typically the use of \Rapture in these applications follows this pattern:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Obtain the ip address or name of the \Rapture environment API endpoint.}
  \item{Obtain the user name and password for the use of the API.}
  \item{Call a login function to obtain a calling context.}
  \item{Pass that login context into a wrapper (for future API use) or simply pass the context into future API calls.}
\end{enumerate}

For example in Java here is a simple code extract for the login and API use process:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Java simple example}, language=Java]
  String host = "test.incapture.net";
  String username = "test";
  String password = "secret";
  SimpleCredentialsProvider creds = new SimpleCredentialsProvider(username, password);
  HttpLoginApi loginApi = new HttpLoginApi(host, creds);
  loginApi.login();

  ScriptClient client = new ScriptClient(loginApi);
  String content = client.getDoc().getContent("//testRepo/doc/one");
  System.out.println(content);
\end{lstlisting}

This example logs into a \Rapture environment and passes that logged in context to a \verb+ScriptClient+
instance. It is this script client that can then be easily used to interact with \Rapture. The
\verb+getContent+ call in the document API will be described in detail later.

In Python, the equivalent interaction is reproduced below:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python simple example}, language=Python]
  import raptureAPI
  url = 'test.incapture.net'
  username = 'test'
  password = 'secret'
  rapture = raptureAPI.raptureAPI(url, username, password)
  content = rapture.doDoc_GetContent('//testRepo/doc/one')
  print content
\end{lstlisting}

Here we see a similar login approach and then the invocation of the same \Rapture
API call. With the same target \Rapture environment these two code snippets will
produce exactly the same output.

\section{Client Reflex scripts}

\Reflex scripts running on the client (or the server) are always running in a
container that has already been connected to an environment -- the wrapper is
the piece of code that has logged into \Rapture already.

In \Reflex then the code is even simpler. In fact \Reflex has some additional
syntax sugar for loading documents from \Rapture.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Reflex simple example}, language=reflex]
  contentAsMap <-- "//testRepo/doc/one";
  println(contentAsMap);

  // or

  content = #doc.getContent("//testRepo/doc/one");
  contentAsMap = fromjson(content);
  println(contentAsMap);
\end{lstlisting}

In the second access example we convert the raw JSON formatted document from
\Rapture into a \Reflex map structure so as to make the two approaches produce
the same output.

\section{Server side kernel applications}

If a Java (or Java VM) application embeds the \Rapture kernel code within it the
means for calling the \Rapture API can have a number of forms. Code running within
\Rapture has to be much more careful about calling contexts and who is actually
making the call, and there is no need to worry about host urls because the code
is running directly on \Rapture.

One approach to running the same example code is reproduced below:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Kernel simple example}, language=Java]
   CallingContext userContext = Kernel.getLogin().login(
          "test", "secret", null);
   String content = Kernel.getDoc().getContent(
          userContext, "//testRepo/doc/one");
   System.out.println(content);
\end{lstlisting}

Note that to run the above code your server application will have had to initialize
and configure itself first, something which is outside the scope of this document
but will trivially be a matter of defining configuration files for connection to
underlying data stores and then calling:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Kernel initialization}, language=Java]
   Kernel.initBootstrap();
\end{lstlisting}

\part{API}
\chapter{API Introduction}
The \Rapture API is divided into a number of sections. We've seen in an earlier
section how you may need to use the \emph{login} api to establish a connection
to \Rapture. The other sections of the API will form the rest of this document.
For each section the general positioning of the section with respect to \Rapture
will be described and then the detailed API calls will follow.
